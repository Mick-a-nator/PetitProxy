# PetitProxy

A tool for players of Magic: The Gathering to create proxies.

Proxies are mock cards for prototyping decks before owning or risking damage to valuable cards. Most proxies available are full-art copies of cards.
These look great, but use a lot of paper and ink. The proxies this tool creates are much more light-weight by printing only the most relevant information.

This tool uses the [Magic: The Gathering API](https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-api) which in turn uses data provided by [mtgjson.com](http://www.mtgjson.com)
